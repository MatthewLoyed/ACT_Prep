## Design Principles

### UX Focus

- **Immediate Value**: Users see their progress and can take action immediately
- **Clear Hierarchy**: Most important information is most prominent
- **Quick Actions**: Common tasks are easily accessible
- **Progress Motivation**: Show improvement and achievements

### UI Focus

- **Consistent with App Theme**: Use existing color system and styling
- **Clean & Modern**: Professional appearance
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes
- **Accessible**: Proper contrast and keyboard navigation

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Complete When:

- [ ] Dashboard page loads with proper layout
- [ ] All components render correctly
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet/desktop
- [ ] Animations and interactions feel smooth
- [ ] Design matches app's visual language
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Components are properly encapsulated

### Ready for Data Integration When:

- [ ] All UI components are complete and tested
- [ ] Component props are properly typed
- [ ] Loading states are implemented
- [ ] Error states are handled
- [ ] User feedback is positive on design

## Notes

- Focus on UI/UX first, functionality second
- Create reusable components for future use
- Maintain consistency with existing app design
- Consider mobile experience as primary
- Use existing color system and design tokens

## Existing Components to Reuse

### Layout & Structure

- **Page Layout**: Use same structure as `Practice.tsx` and `Landing.tsx`
- **Authentication Check**: Copy pattern from `Practice.tsx` and other authenticated pages
- **Responsive Grid**: Use existing grid patterns from `Practice.tsx` table layout
- **Card System**: Reuse card styling from existing pages

### UI Components

- **EngagingLoader**: For loading states
- **AnimatedCounter**: For displaying stats and numbers
- **ProgressCircle**: For progress indicators
- **BlurText**: For gradient text effects
- **Motion Animations**: Use existing Framer Motion patterns
- **Button Styling**: Reuse existing button classes (`btn`, `btn-primary`, `btn-ghost`, etc.)

### Design System

- **Color Variables**: Use existing CSS custom properties from `COLOR_SYSTEM.md`
- **Typography**: Reuse existing font classes and hierarchy
- **Spacing**: Use existing padding/margin patterns
- **Shadows & Borders**: Reuse existing card and component styling
- **Icons**: Use existing Phosphor icons from `@phosphor-icons/react`

### Animations

- **Page Transitions**: Use existing motion patterns from other pages
- **Hover Effects**: Reuse existing hover animations
- **Loading States**: Use EngagingLoader component
- **Micro-interactions**: Follow existing animation patterns

### Navigation

- **Routing**: Use existing navigation patterns
- **Modal System**: Reuse existing modal components if needed
- **Button Actions**: Follow existing button click patterns
