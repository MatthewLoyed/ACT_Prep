# AI ACT Prep - Development Notes

## Completed Tasks ✅

### Authentication & User Management

- ✅ Implemented user authentication with Supabase Auth
- ✅ Added Google OAuth integration
- ✅ Created login/signup pages with email/password and Google sign-in
- ✅ Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
- ✅ Fixed RLS policies to ensure users only see their own data
- ✅ Added user account info to Settings page for debugging
- ✅ Implemented sign out with redirect to homepage
- ✅ Improved user onboarding with better landing page CTAs

### Storage System

- ✅ Implemented Supabase-only storage system
- ✅ Added resume functionality for tests
- ✅ Implemented debounced auto-save for answers
- ✅ Added PDF upload and parsing capabilities

### UI/UX Improvements

- ✅ Dynamic button states and consistent styling
- ✅ Glow effects and text animations
- ✅ Improved layout alignment and spacing
- ✅ Enhanced landing page with contextual CTAs
- ✅ Removed navbar auth buttons in favor of landing page CTAs
- ✅ Added multiple sign-up prompts throughout landing page

## Current Status

### Authentication System ✅ COMPLETE

- **User isolation working**: Each account sees only their own data
- **Google OAuth configured**: Users can sign in with Google accounts
- **RLS policies active**: Database properly filters data by user_id
- **Sign out flow**: Redirects to homepage after sign out
- **User onboarding**: Improved landing page guides users to sign up

### Key Features Working

- ✅ User registration and login
- ✅ Data isolation between accounts
- ✅ PDF import and parsing
- ✅ Test practice with progress tracking
- ✅ Settings management per user
- ✅ Responsive design across devices

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

- `tests` table with `user_id` column for data isolation
- `user_preferences` table for user-specific settings
- `user_tips` and `user_achievements` tables for personalized content
- RLS policies ensure users only access their own data

### Authentication Flow

1. User visits landing page
2. Clicks "Start Practicing Free!" → redirects to signup
3. Signs up with email/password or Google OAuth
4. Gets redirected to import page to add first test
5. All subsequent data is isolated to their account

### Branding Notes

- **App Title**: "TestPrep Pro" (NOT "ACT® Prep Pro")
- **Logo**: Yellow brain icon with hover effects
- **Positioning**: Top-left corner for non-authenticated users
- **Header**: Full navigation for authenticated users

### User Experience Improvements

- **Landing page CTAs**: Contextual buttons based on auth status
- **Multiple sign-up prompts**: Throughout the landing page
- **Clear value proposition**: "Start Practicing Free!" messaging
- **Trust indicators**: "No credit card required" and "30 seconds" messaging
- **Clean auth pages**: Consistent with site's dark gradient theme
- **Professional styling**: Matches the rest of the application's design language
- **Floating brain animations**: Subtle background animations for visual appeal

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Potential Enhancements

- Add email verification flow
- Implement password reset functionality
- Add user profile management
- Consider adding social sharing features
- Implement advanced analytics and progress insights

### UI/UX Improvements Needed

- **Sign Out Confirmation**: Add a confirmation dialog/modal when users click sign out to prevent accidental logouts
- **Homepage Redesign for Authenticated Users**: Rethink the homepage experience after users are signed in - currently shows the same landing page as non-authenticated users

### Critical Issues 🚨

- **Old ACT Parser Broken**: The old ACT parser for ACT practice test 2016-17 is broken for every section except English. This affects Math, Reading, and Science sections. **CRITICAL ISSUE** - needs immediate attention for users with pre-2025 ACT tests.

### Performance Optimizations

- Add loading states for better UX
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize PDF parsing for larger files
- Add offline capability for practice sessions

## TODO - Full Test Implementation

### Overview

Implement a complete ACT® test experience that combines all 4 subjects (Math, Reading, Science, English) into a single timed session.

### Estimated Effort: 2-3 days

### What's Already Built (Low Effort)

- ✅ Question parsing & storage for individual subjects
- ✅ Answer tracking and progress persistence
- ✅ Timer functionality (section and overall)
- ✅ UI components (question display, navigation, feedback)
- ✅ Test completion and review screens

### What Needs to Be Built (Medium Effort)

#### 1. Test Structure & Flow

- Create full test configuration combining all 4 subjects
- Implement subject transitions (Math → Reading → Science → English)
- Add section timers and overall test timer
- Handle breaks between sections

#### 2. Navigation & State Management

- Track current section and question across entire test
- Implement "Next Section" vs "Next Question" logic
- Save progress across section boundaries
- Handle test resumption across sections

#### 3. UI Updates

- Update progress bars to show overall test progress
- Modify navigation to show section names
- Update completion screens for full test results
- Add section transition screens

#### 4. Data Schema

- Extend existing `sessions` table for full test sessions
- Add full test results storage
- Update progress tracking for full tests

### Implementation Priority

1. Create full test wrapper component
2. Extend existing question navigation logic
3. Add section transition logic
4. Update UI for full test progress display
