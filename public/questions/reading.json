    "prompt": "All questions are self-contained. The material covered emphasizes the major content areas that are prerequisites to successful performance in entry-level courses in college mathematics. Knowledge of basic formulas and computational skills are assumed as background for the problems, but recall of complex formulas and extensive computation are not required. Note: You may use a permitted calculator on the mathematics section. See www.act. org/calculator-policy.html for details about prohibited models and features. Nine scores are reported for the mathematics section: a score for the section overall and eight reporting category scores based on specific mathematical knowledge and skills. The approximate percentage of the section devoted to each reporting category is as follows: ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 8 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 Preparing for Higher Math (80%) This category covers the mathematics that students have learned more recently, starting with using algebra as a general way of expressing and solving equations. This category is divided into five subcategories: y Number and Quantity (10-12%): Demonstrate knowledge of real and complex number systems. Reason with numerical quantities in many forms, including expressions with integer and rational exponents and vectors and matrices. y Algebra (17-20%): Solve, graph, and model multiple types of expressions. Interpret and use many different kinds of equations, such as linear, polynomial, radical, and exponential relationships. Find solutions to systems of equations, even when represented by a simple matrix equation, and apply results to real-world contexts. y Functions (17-20%): Demonstrate knowledge of functions: definition, notation, representation, and application. Use functions including linear, radical, piecewise, polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic. Manipulate and translate functions, as well as interpret and use important features of graphs. y Geometry (17-20%): Apply your knowledge of shapes and solids, using concepts such as congruence and similarity relationships or surface area and volume measurements. Apply your understanding to composite objects and solve for missing values in triangles, circles, and other figures. Use trigonometric ratios and equations of conic sections. y Statistics & Probability (12-15%): Describe center and spread of distributions. Apply and analyze data collection methods. Understand and model relationships in bivariate data. Calculate probabilities by recognizing the related sample spaces. Integrating Essential Skills (20%) This category focuses on measuring how well you can synthesize and apply your knowledge and skills to solve more complex problems. The questions ask you to address concepts such as y rates and percentages; y proportional relationships; y area, surface area, and volume; y average and median; and y expressing numbers in different ways. You will solve non-routine problems that involve combining skills in chains of steps, applying skills in varied contexts, understanding connections, and demonstrating fluency. Modeling This category represents all questions that involve producing, interpreting, understanding, evaluating, and improving models. Each question is also counted in other appropriate mathematics reporting categories. This category is an overall measure of how well you use modeling skills across mathematical topics. Tips for Taking the Mathematics Section 9 If you use a calculator, use it wisely. All of the mathematics problems can be solved without a calculator. Many of the problems are best done without a calculator. Use good judgment in deciding when to use a calculator. For example, for some problems you may wish to do scratch work to clarify your thoughts on the question before you begin using a calculator to do computations. 9 Solve the problem. To work out solutions to the problems, you will usually do scratch work. You may wish to glance over the answer choices after reading the questions. However, working backwards from all four answer choices can take a lot of time and may not be effective. 9 Find your solution among the answer choices. Once you have solved the problem, look for your answer among the choices. If your answer is not included among the choices, carefully reread the problem to see whether you missed important information. Pay careful attention to the question being asked. If an equation is to be selected, check to see whether the equation you think is best can be transformed into one of the answer choices provided. 9 Make sure you answer the question. The solutions to many questions will involve several steps. Make sure your answer accounts for all the necessary steps. Frequently, an answer choice is an intermediate result, not the final answer. 9 Make sure your answer is reasonable. Sometimes an error in computation will result in an answer that is not practically possible for the situation described. Always think about your answer to determine whether it is reasonable. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 9 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 9 Check your answer. You may arrive at an incorrect solution by making common errors in the problem-solving process. If there is time remaining before the end of the mathematics section, it is important that you reread the questions and check your answers to make sure they are correct. Reading Section The reading section measures your ability to read closely, reason logically about texts using evidence, and integrate information from multiple sources. The questions focus on the mutually supportive skills that readers must bring to bear in studying written materials across a range of subject areas. Specifically, questions will ask you to do the following: y determine main ideas y locate and interpret significant details y understand sequences of events y make comparisons y comprehend cause-effect relationships y determine the meaning of context- dependent words, phrases, and statements y draw generalizations y analyze the author’s or narrator’s voice and method y analyze claims and evidence in arguments y integrate information from multiple texts or formats The reading section is composed of multiple parts. Some parts consist of one long prose passage and others consist of shorter prose passages. The passages represent the levels and kinds of texts commonly encountered in first-year college curricula. Each passage is preceded by a heading that identifies the author and source; it may also include important background information to help you understand the passage. Each portion contains a set of multiple-choice questions. These questions do not test the rote recall of facts from outside the passage or rules of formal logic, nor do they contain isolated vocabulary questions. In sections that contain two shorter passages, some of the questions involve both of those passages. Four scores are reported for the reading section: a score for the section overall and three reporting category scores based on specific knowledge and skills. The approximate percentage of the section devoted to each reporting category is as follows: Key Ideas & Details (44-52%) This category requires you to read texts closely to determine central ideas and themes; summarize information and ideas accurately; draw logical inferences and conclusions; and show an understanding of relationships, including sequential, comparative, and cause- effect relationships. Craft & Structure (26-33%) These questions ask you to do the following: y determine word and phrase meanings y analyze an author’s word choice rhetorically y analyze text structure y understand the author’s purpose and perspective y analyze characters’ points of view y interpret authorial decisions rhetorically y differentiate between various perspectives and sources of information Integration of Knowledge & Ideas (19- 26%) This category requires you to understand authors’ claims, differentiate between facts and opinions, and use evidence to make connections between different texts that are related by topic. Some questions will require you to analyze how authors construct arguments and to evaluate reasoning and evidence from various sources. Visual and Quantitative Information in the Reading Section One passage may be accompanied by an element like a graph, figure, or table that contains information relevant to the reading task. In the passage containing these visual and quantitative elements, some of the questions will ask you to identify or interpret information from the graphic or integrate the information from the passage and graphic to determine the best answer. Tips for Taking the Reading Section 9 Read each passage carefully. Before you begin answering a question, read all of the content carefully. Be conscious of relationships between or among ideas. Take notes about important ideas in the passages. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 10 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 9 Refer to the passages when answering the questions. Answers to some of the questions will be found by referring to what is explicitly stated in the passages. Other questions will require you to determine implicit meanings and to draw conclusions, comparisons, and generalizations. Consider the text before you answer any question. Science Section(optional) If you are taking the optional science section, it will be administered after the reading test. The science section measures the interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem- solving skills required in the natural sciences. The section presents several authentic scientific scenarios, each followed by a number of multiple-choice questions. The content includes biology, chemistry, Earth/ space sciences (e.g., geology, astronomy, and meteorology), and physics. Advanced knowledge in these areas is not required, but background knowledge acquired in general, introductory science courses may be needed to correctly answer some of the questions. The science section focuses on multidimensional assessment, with questions that assess science content in concert with science skills and practices. The questions require you to: y recognize and understand the basic features of, and concepts related to, the provided information; y examine critically the relationship between the information provided and the conclusions drawn or hypotheses developed; and y generalize from given information to gain new information, draw conclusions, or make predictions. Note: You are not permitted to use a calculator in the science section. Four scores are reported for the science section: a score for the section overall and three reporting category scores based on scientific knowledge, skills, and practices. The approximate percentage of the section devoted to each reporting category is as follows: Interpretation of Data (38-50%) This category asks you to manipulate and analyze scientific data presented in scientific tables, graphs, and diagrams (e.g., recognize trends in data, translate tabular data into graphs, interpolate and extrapolate, and reason mathematically). Scientific Investigation (18-32%) This category requires you to understand experimental tools, procedures, and design (e.g., identify controls and variables) and compare, extend, and modify experiments (e.g., predict the results of additional trials). Evaluation of Scientific Arguments and Models with Evidence (24-38%) These questions ask you to judge the validity of scientific information and formulate conclusions and predictions based on that information (e.g., determine which explanation for a scientific phenomenon is supported by new findings). The science section presents information in three formats: y Data Representation (26-32%): This format presents graphic and tabular material similar to that found in science journals and texts. The questions associated with this format measure skills such as recognizing relationships among data in tables and graphs; interpolating and extrapolating; and translating tabular data into graphs. y Research Summaries (50-56%): This format provides descriptions and results of one or more related experiments. The questions focus on the design of the experiments and the interpretation of experimental results. y Conflicting Viewpoints (18-21%): This format presents two or more explanations for the same scientific phenomena that, because they are based on differing premises or incomplete data, are inconsistent with one another. The questions focus on the understanding, analysis, and comparison of alternative viewpoints or hypotheses. Tips for Taking the Science Section 9 Read the passage carefully. Before you begin answering a question, read the scientific material provided. It is important that you read the entire text and examine any tables, graphs, or figures. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 11 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 You may take notes about important ideas. Some of the information sets will describe experiments. You should consider the experimental design, including the controls and variables, because questions are likely to address this component of scientific research. 9 Note the different viewpoints in passages. Some material will present conflicting viewpoints, and the questions will ask you to distinguish among them. It may be helpful for you to take notes summarizing each viewpoint. Writing Section (Optional) If you register for the A C T with writing, you will take the writing section after all the multiple- choice sections. Your score in the writing section will not affect your scores on the multiple-choice sections or your Composite score. The writing section is a 40-minute essay test that measures your writing skills—specifically, writing skills taught in high school English classes and in entry-level college composition courses. The section consists of one writing prompt that describes a complex issue and provides three different perspectives on the issue. You are asked to read the prompt and write an essay in which you develop your own perspective on the issue. Your essay must analyze the relationship between your own perspective and one or more other perspectives. You may adopt one of the perspectives given in the prompt as your own, or you may introduce one that is completely different from those given. Your score will not be affected by the perspective you take on the issue. Five scores are reported for the writing section: a single subject-level writing score reported on a scale of 2–12 and four domain scores that are based on an analytic scoring rubric. The subject score is the rounded average of the four domain scores. The four writing domains are as follows: Ideas and Analysis Scores in this domain reflect the ability to generate productive ideas and engage critically with multiple perspectives on the given issue. Competent writers understand the issue they are invited to address, the purpose for writing, and the audience. They generate ideas that are relevant to the situation. Development and Support Scores in this domain reflect the ability to discuss ideas, offer rationale, and bolster an argument. Competent writers explain and explore their ideas, discuss implications, and illustrate through examples. They help the reader understand their thinking about the issue. Organization Scores in this domain reflect the ability to organize ideas with clarity and purpose. Organizational choices are integral to effective writing. Competent writers arrange their essay in a way that clearly shows the relationship between ideas, and they guide the reader through their discussion. Language Use and Conventions Scores in this domain reflect the ability to use written language to convey arguments with clarity. Competent writers make use of the conventions of grammar, syntax, word usage, and mechanics. They are also aware of their audience and adjust the style and tone of their writing to communicate effectively. Tips for Taking the Writing Section 9 Pace yourself. Budget your time based on your experience in taking essay tests in school or when you have done writing within a time limit. It is unlikely that you will have time to draft, revise, and recopy your essay. 9 Plan. Before writing, carefully read and consider all prompt material. Be sure you understand the issue, the different perspectives on the issue, and your essay task. Included with the prompt are planning questions that will help you analyze the different perspectives and develop your own. Use these questions to think critically about the prompt and generate an effective response. How would you best organize and support your ideas in a written argument? Spend time structuring or outlining your response. Note: The planning questions are optional and are not scored. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 12 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 9 Write. Establish the focus of your essay by making clear your argument and its main ideas. y Explain and illustrate your ideas with sound reasoning and meaningful examples. y Discuss the significance of your ideas: what are the implications of what you have to say, and why is your argument important to consider? As you write, ask yourself if your logic is clear, if you have supported your claims, and if you have chosen precise words to communicate your ideas. 9 Review your essay. Try to make your essay as polished as you can. Take a few minutes before time is called to read over your essay and correct any mistakes. If you take the A C T on paper, be sure to write your essay legibly. If you find words that are hard to read, recopy them. Make corrections and revisions neatly, between the lines. Do not write in the margins. 9 Practice. There are many ways to prepare for the writing section. Read newspapers and magazines; watch or listen to news analyses online, on TV, or on the radio; or participate in discussions and debates, thinking carefully about other perspectives in relation to your own. One good way to prepare for the writing section is to practice writing with different purposes for different audiences. The writing you do in your classes will help you, as will writing a personal journal, stories, essays, editorials, or other writing you do on your own. It is also a good idea to practice writing within a time limit. Taking the practice writing test will give you a sense of how much additional practice you may need. You might want to take the practice writing section even if you do not plan to take the A C T with writing. It will help you build skills that are important in college- level learning and the world of work. Taking the Practice Tests It is a good idea to take the practice tests under conditions as similar as possible to those you will experience on test day. The following tips will help you: y If you are taking the A C T (without science or writing), the three multiple-choice tests require 2 hours 20 minutes to complete. Take them in order, in one sitting, with a 10-to-15- minute break between Tests 2 and 3. If you take the ACT with science, the four multiple- choice sections of the test require 3 hours, with a 10- to 15- minute break between Tests 2 and 3. y You will need only sharpened, soft lead No. 2 pencils and good erasers. Remove all other items from your desk. You will not be allowed to use unapproved scratch paper, but you can use the test booklet to make notes. y If you plan to use a permitted calculator on the mathematics test, use the same one you will use on test day. y Use a digital timer or clock to time yourself on each practice test. Set your timer for five minutes less than the time allowed for each test so you can get used to the verbal announcement of five minutes remaining. y Give yourself only the time allowed for each test. y Detach and use the sample answer document on pages 64 – 60 . y Read the test directions on the first page of each multiple-choice test. These are the same directions that will appear in your test booklet on test day. y Start your timer and begin with Test 1. Continue through Test 4,if taking the optional science section, or end after Test 3 if you are not taking the science section. taking a 10-to-15-minute break between Tests 2 and 3. Use the timing table on page 2 to time each section of the test. y Score your multiple-choice tests using the information beginning on page 72 . y If you plan to take the A C T with writing, read the directions on the first page of the practice A C T writing test ( page 81 ). These are the same directions that will appear in your test booklet on test day. Start your timer (set for 40 minutes), then read the prompt on page 61 . After you understand what the prompt is asking you to do, plan your essay and then write it on lined paper. On test day, if you test on paper, your answer document will have lined pages on which you will write your essay. Score your essay using the information on pages 78–80 . y A screen reader accessible practice test is available at https://practice.actdigitalservices. org/ . ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 13 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 This booklet contains tests in English, mathematics, reading, and science. These tests measure skills and abilities highly related to high school course work and success in college. Calculators may be used on the mathematics test only. The questions in each test are numbered, and the suggested answers for each question are lettered. On the answer document, the rows of ovals are numbered to match the questions, and the ovals in each row are lettered to correspond to the suggested answers. For each question, first decide which answer is best. Next, locate on the answer document the row of ovals numbered the same as the question. Then, locate the oval in that row lettered the same as your answer. Finally, fill in the oval completely. Use a soft lead pencil and make your marks heavy and black. Do not use ink or a mechanical pencil. Mark only one answer to each question. If you change your mind about an answer, erase your first mark thoroughly before marking your new answer. For each question, make certain that you mark in the row of ovals with the same number as the question. Only responses marked on your answer document will be scored. Your score on each test will be based only on the number of questions you answer correctly during the time allowed for that test. You will not be penalized for guessing. It is to your advantage to answer every question even if you must guess. You may work on each test only when the testing staff tells you to do so. If you finish a test before time is called for that test, you should use the time remaining to reconsider questions you are uncertain about in that test. You may not look back to a test on which time has already been called, and you may not go ahead to another test. To do so will disqualify you from the examination. Lay your pencil down immediately when time is called at the end of each test. You may not for any reason fill in or alter ovals for a test after time is called for that test. To do so will disqualify you from the examination. Do not fold or tear the pages of your test booklet. DO NOT OPEN THIS BOOKLET UNTIL TOLD TO DO SO.

In a country where European cuisine was held in the highest regard, they said, no one would patronize a restaurant serving Brazilian food. Atala, whose restaurant has consistently ranked among the world’s best, has long disproven the naysayers. Using traditional Brazilian ingredients, such as, manioc root and even ants—in innovative ways, he has thrilled diners from around the world. Still, Atala felt he could do more for his country and its cuisine. In 2012, he founded Instituto Atá to help promote lesser-known ingredients, particularly those of the Amazon basin, while working to protect Brazil’s biodiversity. Hearts of palm, for example, were typically 1. Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable? ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 15 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. 1 1 harvested from Brazil’s wild juçara palms in an unsustainable way. Needing eight years to mature, the tree dies once its large heart is removed. Atala began persuading producers to cultivate Amazonian pupunha palms, which grow clusters of stems, each with a small heart. Careful harvesting ensures that the tree will live to yield more hearts, resulting in environmentally friendly production. Atala prioritizes his working relationships with Amazonian tribes. Utilizing their historical know-how they have, he aims to bolster tribe members’ livelihoods while exposing a wider audience to Brazilian ingredients. For instance, Baniwa women have farmed distinctly flavorful chili peppers for centuries that use indigenous agricultural techniques, to create a seasoning called pimenta jiquitaia. Partnering with Instituto Atá have enabled these women from a remote rain forest region to scale up production and market their product globally. Expanding awareness of the rich diversity of Brazil’s native ingredients, Atala continues to lead in deciphering the country’s food culture. With his characteristic passion and intensity, the renowned chef seeks to inspire Brazilians to rediscover the connections between culture, nature, and food. 5.

Although little is known about her life, scholars agree Hrosvitha was born to a noble family around 935 CE. As a relation of Holy Roman Emperor Otto I, she most likely spent her early years as part of his court. Later, sometime before 959 CE, she entered the abbey at Gandersheim, it was well known as a significant center of learning. Hrosvitha entered Gandersheim as a canoness rather than a nun. Her title did not require a vow of poverty, but Hrosvitha did take the abbey’s customary vow of chastity, which absolved her of an obligation to marry. This circumstance made it okay for her to keep her financial status without incurring responsibilities to a husband and children. Nevertheless, Hrosvitha had a greater level of independence—she could acquire property, receive guests, employ servants, and visit the royal court—than most women of her time. Hrosvitha produced at least eight narrative religious poems, two historical epics (about the court of Otto I and Gandersheim), and six comedy-dramas. It is for these dramas that she is best known today. 11. Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable? ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved.

I turn off the gridlocked highway, onto a stretch of Route 66 that is, surrounded by arid New Mexico hills. When we’re nearly three miles into our detour, I roll down the windows. Looking pointedly into the rearview mirror, windows rolled down, I say something about not throwing anything out of the car, but neither boy is listening. I check my speed. [ A ] Carefully, I steer toward the fog line. “Here it is, boys!” I yell at the backseat, the passenger-side tires finding the rumble strips etched into the asphalt. [2] Normal rumble strips create that loud, grating noise when you drive over them—like a built-in alarm for drivers who drift too close to the road’s edge. These strips are different. The boys abruptly stop their squalling as the car begins to vibrate. Then, instead of that jolting warning noise, we hear the distinct strain of the song “America the Beautiful.” [ B ] The road is playing us a song. [3] I’ve been taking this detour out of Albuquerque for two years, ever since these musical rumble strips were installed. City planners wanted to find out whether the novelty of hearing a snippet of song would give drivers an incentive to obey the speed limit; the tune is only recognizable if they’re going a reasonable forty-five miles per hour. Whether this strategy works, I don’t know. 16. Which choice makes the sentence most grammatically acceptable? F.

Even though constant traffic has worn down the musical rumble strips and warped the sound of some of the notes, there are currently no plans to restore the strips. [4] After the last one of the notes fades into the darkening sky, I glance back at the boys, who have been lulled by the wonder of the song. [ D ] I stop worrying about work, about how many toy cars might have gotten lost between there and home. Until then, I feel like everything is going to be just fine. 8 20. Given that all the choices are accurate, which one most effectively leads into the rest of the essay? F. No Change G. lots of other drivers, not just me, still make this detour to hear the tune.

Unfortunately, due to space constraints, a typical museum only exhibits about ten percent of the items in its collection; the other ninety percent remains in storage. When displaying such a small portion of artifacts severely limits public access and therefore public education. Furthermore, maintaining such a large number of artifacts in storage while acquiring additional items makes finding enough suitable storage space difficult, especially for delicate items. [ A ] [2] To remain true to the goals of education and stewardship, museums should dedicate public access space to visible storage. [ B ] Also known as open storage, visible storage provides ways to display many items in small or irregular spaces, allowing more artifacts to be on exhibit. [ C ] 25. The writer wants to add the following sentence to the essay: It is marvelously quiet. The sentence would most logically be placed at: ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 20 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. 1 1 [3] In a traditional museum display, each artifact is labeled and positioned at eye level with plenty of space between it and the other objects. Subsequently, artifacts in visible storage spaces are placed close together and are often displayed from floor to ceiling with few labels. Areas of a museum that cannot house a traditional display, therefore, might be ideal for a visible storage display. Ceramic pottery where it might otherwise be positioned in individual glass cases might be lined up on shelves behind a glass wall. An antique fork and spoon fastened to a large informational board might instead be part of an entire set of silverware arranged under glass in pull-out cabinet drawers. [ D ] [4] While some artifacts can never be displayed @ , many pieces that can—and should—be viewed are not. 29.

PASSAGE V The Sociable Weavers’ Complex Nest In the sparse yet relatively green environment of the Kalahari Desert, birds known as sociable weavers build their enormous nests atop the desert’s signature camelthorn trees. Slung across the branches, each nest—which can measure up to thirteen feet wide and seven feet thick—is a sprawling community home to hundreds of birds. D 34.

The writer wants to add the following sentence to the essay: This potentially compromises stewardship. For the sake of logic and cohesion, the sentence should be placed at: ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 22 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. 1 1 A weaver nest does not resemble a common bowl-like bird nest. Although the weavers use typical materials such as sticks, grass, and feathers to construct their nests, the nests look more like disorganized piles. Built within each nest are as many as one hundred four-to-six-inch-wide chambers. A bird enters a chamber by flying to the underside of the nest, it squeezes through a one-inch-wide entrance hole, and continuing up a passageway to a chamber. In each chamber, up to five of the sparrow-sized birds can huddle as a group together when the Kalahari nights get cold.

Pang Xiong Sirirathasuk Sikoun is a master of paj ntaub , or “flower cloth” embroidery, the most difficult of the century’s-oldest Hmong needlework arts. Paj ntaub is increasingly made in lighter, softer shades today. She’s been creating stitched textiles since she was a young woman living in northern Laos. For the past several decades, she’s been designing paj ntaub in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she also teaches her craft. Flower cloth (commonly as a shirt, dress, coat, or collar) is made to be worn as clothing and, depending on the amount of needlework on the piece, is designed either for everyday wear or for a special occasion. 41. Which choice best maintains the stylistic pattern of descriptions established earlier in the sentence? ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 24 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. 1 1 With pattern names such as “elephant’s foot” and “snail house” and images of animals framed by geometric designs, paj ntaub patterns are versatile. What distinguishes paj ntaub from other Hmong needlework arts are the artist’s use of tiny, tight stitches and several complex techniques. One technique is reverse appliqué, in which shapes are cut out from, rather than added on top of, the embroidered fabric. Another is elaborate overstitching: thousands of layered stitches are applied to its surface. Pang Xiong regrets that most people she knows today wear only regular clothes. When she was growing up in Laos, she explains, she had few items of clothing, but each garment she owned was handcrafted paj ntaub . 45. Which choice most clearly builds on the information provided earlier in the sentence about a common theme in paj ntaub patterns and images? ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved.

Pang Xiong teaches paj ntaub in art museums—including at the Smithsonian Institution, where some of her textiles are on permanent display—and in community settings around Philadelphia. R Pang Xiong is showing a new generation the joys of paj ntaub and beautiful handcrafted clothing. 49.

GO ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. 3 3 Passage I LITERARY NARRATIVE: This passage is adapted from the short story “Janus” by Ann Beattie (©1985 by The New Yorker Magazine, Inc.). The bowl was perfect. Perhaps it was not what you’d select if you faced a shelf of bowls, and not the sort of thing that would inevitably attract a lot of atten- tion at a crafts fair, yet it had real presence. It was as predictably admired as a mutt who has no reason to sus- pect he might be funny. Just such a dog, in fact, was often brought out (and in) along with the bowl. Andrea was a real-estate agent, and when she thought that some prospective buyers might be dog- lovers, she would drop off her dog at the same time she placed the bowl in the house that was up for sale. She would put a dish of water in the kitchen for Mondo, take his squeaking plastic frog out of her purse and drop it on the floor. He would pounce delightedly, just as he did every day at home, batting around his favorite toy. The bowl usually sat on a coffee table, though recently she had displayed it on top of a pine blanket chest and on a lacquered table. It was once placed on a cherry table beneath a glorious still-life painting, where it held its own. Everyone who has purchased a house or who has wanted to sell a house must be familiar with some of the tricks used to convince a buyer that the house is quite special: a fire in the fireplace in early evening; jonquils in a pitcher on the kitchen counter, where no one ordinarily has space to put flowers; perhaps the slight aroma of spring, made by a single drop of scent vaporizing from a lamp bulb. The wonderful thing about the bowl, Andrea thought, was that it was both subtle and noticeable—a paradox of a bowl. Its glaze was the color of cream and seemed to glow no matter what light it was placed in. There were a few bits of color in it—tiny geometric flashes—and some of these were tinged with flecks of silver. They were as mysterious as cells seen under a microscope; it was difficult not to study them, because they shimmered, flashing for a split second, and then resumed their shape. Something about the colors and their random placement suggested motion. People who liked country furniture always commented on the bowl, but then it turned out that people who felt comfortable with opulence loved it just as much. But the bowl was not at all ostentatious, or even so noticeable that anyone would suspect that it had been put in place deliberately. They might notice the height of the ceiling on first entering a room, and only when their eye moved down from that, or away from the refraction of sunlight on a pale wall, would they see the bowl. Then they would go immediately to it and comment. Yet they always fal- tered when they tried to say something. Perhaps it was because they were in the house for a serious reason, not to notice some object. Once, Andrea got a call from a woman who had not put in an offer on a house she had shown her. That bowl, she said—would it be possible to find out where the owners had bought that beautiful bowl? Andrea pre- tended that she did not know what the woman was referring to. A bowl, somewhere in the house? Oh, on a table under the window. Yes, she would ask, of course. She let a couple of days pass, then called back to say that the bowl had been a present and the people did not know where it had been purchased. She was sure that the bowl brought her luck. Bids were often put in on houses where she had displayed the bowl. Sometimes the owners, who were always asked to be away or to step outside when the house was being shown, didn’t even know that the bowl had been in their house. Once—she could not imagine how—she left it behind, and then she was so afraid that something might have happened to it that she rushed back to the house and sighed with relief when the owner opened the door. The bowl, Andrea explained—she had pur- chased a bowl and set it on the chest for safekeeping while she toured the house with the prospective buyers, and she . . . She felt like rushing past the frowning woman and seizing her bowl. The owner stepped aside. In the few seconds before Andrea picked up the bowl, she realized that the owner must have just seen that it had been perfectly placed, that the sunlight struck the bluer part of it. Her pitcher had been moved to the far side of the chest, and the bowl predominated. All the way home, Andrea wondered how she could have left the bowl behind. It was like leaving a friend at an outing—just walking off. Sometimes there were stories in the paper about families forgetting a child some- where and driving to the next city. Andrea had only gone a mile down the road before she remembered. 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved.

Originally cultivated in the Ottoman Empire, tulips were intro- duced to Europe at the end of the sixteenth century and became wildly popular in the seventeenth century. One crucial element of the beauty of the tulip that intoxicated the Dutch, the Turks, the French, and the English has been lost to us. To them the tulip was a magic flower because it was prone to spontaneous and brilliant eruptions of color. In a planting of a hundred tulips, one of them might be so possessed, opening to reveal the white or yellow ground of its petals painted, as if by the finest brush and steadiest hand, with intri- cate feathers or flames of a vividly contrasting hue. When this happened, the tulip was said to have “broken,” and if a tulip broke in a particularly striking manner—if the flames of the applied color reached clear to the petal’s lip, say, and its pigment was bril- liant and pure and its pattern symmetrical—the owner of that bulb had won the lottery. For the offsets of that bulb would inherit its pattern and hues and command a fantastic price. The fact that broken tulips for some unknown reason produced fewer and smaller offsets than ordinary tulips drove their prices still higher. Semper Augustus was the most famous such break. The closest we have to a broken tulip today is the group known as the Rembrandts—so named because Rembrandt painted some of the most admired breaks of his time. But these latter-day tulips, with their heavy patterning of one or more contrasting colors, look clumsy by comparison, as if painted in haste with a thick brush. To judge from the paintings we have of the originals, the petals of broken tulips could be as fine and intricate as marbleized papers, the extravagant swirls of color somehow managing to seem both bold and delicate at once. In the most striking examples— such as the fiery carmine that Semper Augustus splashed on its pure white ground—the outbreak of color juxtaposed with the orderly, linear form of the tulip could be breathtaking, with the leaping, wayward patterns just barely contained by the petal’s edge. Anna Pavord recounts the extraordinary lengths to which Dutch growers would go to make their tulips break, sometimes borrowing their techniques from alchemists, who faced what must have seemed a com- parable challenge. Over the earth above a bed planted with white tulips, gardeners would liberally sprinkle paint powders of the desired hue, on the theory that rainwater would wash the color down to the roots, where it would be taken up by the bulb. Charlatans sold recipes believed to produce the magic color breaks; pigeon droppings were thought to be an effective agent, as was plaster dust taken from the walls of old houses. Unlike the alchemists, whose attempts to change base metals into gold reliably failed, now and then the would-be tulip changers would be rewarded with a good break, inspiring everybody to redouble their efforts. What the Dutch could not have known was that a virus was responsible for the magic of the broken tulip, a fact that, as soon as it was discovered, doomed the beauty it had made possible. The color of a tulip actu- ally consists of two pigments working in concert—a base color that is always yellow or white and a second, laid-on color called an anthocyanin; the mix of these two hues determines the unitary color we see. The virus works by partially and irregularly suppressing the anthocyanin, thereby allowing a portion of the under- lying color to show through. It wasn’t until the 1920s, after the invention of the electron microscope, that sci- entists discovered the virus was being spread from tulip to tulip by Myzus persicae , the peach potato aphid. Peach trees were a common feature of seventeenth- century gardens. By the 1920s the Dutch regarded their tulips as commodities to trade rather than jewels to display, and since the virus weakened the bulbs it infected (the reason the offsets of broken tulips were so small and few in number), Dutch growers set about ridding their fields of the infection. Color breaks, when they did occur, were promptly destroyed, and a certain peculiar manifestation of natural beauty abruptly lost its claim on human affection. I can’t help thinking that the virus was supplying something the tulip needed, just the touch of abandon the flower’s chilly formality called for. Maybe that’s why the broken tulip became such a treasure in seventeenth-century Holland: the wayward color loosed on a tulip by a good break perfected the flower, even as the virus responsible set about destroying it. On its face the story of the virus and the tulip would seem to throw a wrench into any evolutionary understanding of beauty.

Schloss (©2009 by Oxford University Press). Passage B is from the book The Tanning of America: How Hip-Hop Created a Culture That Rewrote the Rules of the New Economy by Steve Stoute with Mim Eichler Rivas (©2011 by Steve Stoute). Passage A by Joseph G. Schloss The term b-boying refers to break dancing. In the first sense of the term, hip-hop refers collec- tively to a group of related art forms in different media (visual, sound, movement) that were practiced in Afro- Caribbean, African American, and Latino neighbor- hoods in New York City in the 1970s. The term, when used in this sense, also refers to the events at which these forms were practiced, the people who practiced them, their shared aesthetic sensibility, and contempo- rary activities that maintain those traditions. Perhaps the most important aspect of this variety of hip-hop is that it is unmediated, in the sense that most of the practices associated with it are both taught and performed in the context of face-to-face interac- tions between human beings. To some degree, this con- stitutes an intentional rejection of the mass media by its practitioners, but to a great extent it is just the natural result of the practices themselves. Activities like b-boying and graffiti writing are simply not well suited to the mass media. Although in both cases, brief attempts were made to bring these forms of expression into mainstream contexts (b-boying in a series of low- budget “breaksploition” movies in the early 1980s and graffiti as part of a short-lived gallery trend around the same time), neither developed substantially in those environments. This, it has been suggested, was not so much because the forms lacked appeal, but because— on an economic level—b-boying was an advertisement with no product. This reality is reflected in the phrase that is often used to refer to this branch of hip-hop: “hip-hop culture,” which suggests something that is lived rather than bought and sold. The second sense of the term hip-hop refers to a form of popular music that developed, or was devel- oped, out of hip-hop culture. This hip-hop, also known as “rap music,” resulted from the interaction between hip-hop culture and the preexisting music industry. As we would expect, this hip-hop features elements of both sensibilities. My students are often surprised when I point out that, even when hip-hop lyrics seem to reject every aspect of mainstream culture and morality, the one thing they almost never reject is a strict 16-bar verse structure derived from Tin Pan Alley pop music. But this should not be surprising. This hip-hop, in con- trast to hip-hop culture, is deeply intertwined with the mass media and its needs, largely because it does have a product: records, CDs, MP3s, and ringtones. Passage B by Steve Stoute It wasn’t until I was nine years old, late in 1979, that I even heard the words “hip” and “hop” strung together or was able to grasp the notion of what being a rapper actually meant. That was when, fatefully, I heard a record that changed my life (and pop culture) forever. Like it’s yesterday, I can still remember that moment over at my aunt’s home in Brooklyn—where it seemed there was always a party under way with rela- tives and neighbors hanging out, a great spread of food, and new, hot music on the record player. Most stereo systems in those days could be adapted for the single two-sided records that were smaller and had the big hole in the middle (45 RPM) as well as the bigger records with the small holes (33 ⅓ RPM)—which were the full albums that had several songs on each side. But as the intro plays to what I recognize as “Good Times” by the group Chic and I’m drawn into the living room because it’s a familiar hit song from the previous summer, I encounter a record on the turntable that defies categorization. Instead of the sweet female lead vocals of that disco smash, I hear something totally dif- ferent and spot a baby-blue label on the black vinyl record I’ve never seen before. Even though it’s a twelve-inch disc, the size of an album, as I listen to the rhyming words being spoken—“ Singin’ on ’n’ ’n’ on ’n’ on / The beat don’t stop until the break of dawn / Singin’ on ’n’ ’n’ on ’n’ on on ’n’ on / Like a hot but- tered a pop da pop da pop dibbie dibbie pop da pop pop / Ya don’t dare stop ”—it hits me that this entire side is one long song. Almost fifteen minutes long as it turns out. Or, to be exact, fourteen minutes and thirty-six seconds of pure fun laid over the thumping bass beat from the break of “Good Times” with sing-along words easy to remember and repeat. The record, I discover, is by an unknown group, the Sugarhill Gang, and is called “Rapper’s Delight.” From then on, nobody ever has to tell me what rap is. It’s whatever words are spoken, chanted, or talk- sung, or whatever philosophies, stories, or ideas are espoused, by the house party Master of Ceremonies. 19. According to Passage A, one reason elements of hip-hop culture such as b-boying are rarely represented in mass media is that these art forms: ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved.

The term “living fossil” refers to creatures that had emerged long ago and seemed to have stopped evolving. Like all living fossils, crocodiles were thought to have emerged in the distant past and then stayed largely unchanged. The standard theory held that the crocodil- ian species we know today originated in Africa during the Cretaceous (145 to 66 million years ago), when the seven continents were much closer together. As the continents drifted apart, the crocodilians went with them, explaining how they ended up in a band of trop- ics encircling the globe. If that were true, then modern crocodilian species should be very different from one another at the level of genes and molecules, because there would have been more than enough time for sub- stantial mutations to accumulate. By the 1990s, how- ever, molecular analysis revealed that immune system molecules conserved across living crocodilian species were remarkably similar in structure and behavior. Intrigued by this puzzle, a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Washington named Jamie Oaks began collecting DNA samples from all 23 living crocodilian species, comparing sections of the genome where mutations were most likely to have appeared. Oaks did not find nearly as many differences between the modern crocodilian genomes as one would expect had those species diverged all the way back in the Cre- taceous. He concluded that modern crocodilian species split from their last common ancestor between 8 and 13 million years ago, not long before ancient hominins split from their last common ancestor with chimpan- zees. The living fossil theory of crocodiles had overes- timated their evolutionary age by about a factor of 10. Oaks also noticed something odd about the DNA samples he had acquired from the iconic Nile croco- diles ( Crocodylus niloticus ): they did not match up with each other. In fact, the variation between them was great enough to suggest that he was looking at two dis- tinct species. If so, then not only were modern croco- diles much too young to be living fossils, but they had also continued to speciate after diverging from their basal ancestor—something living fossils are not sup- posed to do. On its own, Oaks’ study was intriguing, but not enough to convince the larger scientific commu- nity to cleave the Nile crocodile into two species. Unbeknownst to him, however, a separate team of scientists was preparing to corroborate his results. In the early 2000s, on an excursion to Chad, the wildlife conservationist Michael Klemens encountered some odd little crocodiles in a desert oasis. They were so docile that he and his companions could swim beside them without concern. He took a tissue sample from one that had recently perished and sent it to the Ameri- can Museum of Natural History in New York City, where Evon Hekkala, an assistant professor at Fordham University studying crocodilian diversity, sequenced its genome. When she compared the docile croc’s DNA to other Nile crocodiles, she noticed some rather striking differences. Could these tame crocs be an entirely dis- tinct species? DNA analysis of 123 African crocodiles—as well as 57 separate samples from museum specimens, including crocodiles mummified in ancient Egypt— confirmed her suspicion. In a few sections of their respective genomes, all the mild-mannered crocs would have one DNA sequence, and all the typical Nile crocs another. They even had different numbers of chromo- somes. “That made us very confident that there were actually two different populations and they were not mixing their DNA,” Hekkala says. The two different species had diverged between 3 and 6 million years ago: Crocodylus niloticus in the East and the smaller, less aggressive Crocodylus suchus in the West.

Many of these ice shelves are melting, causing them to calve (break off ) large pieces known as icebergs. Four students each explain iceberg calving. Student 1 Antarctic ice shelves melt due to the warming of the air above the surface of the ice during the summer. When the air temperature increases, the surface ice melts and water pools. The meltwater moves downward into the ice shelf, causing fractures to form. The accumulation of many fractures in the ice over many summers gradually leads to icebergs calving from an ice shelf. Student 2 Student 1 is correct that an increase in air temperature during the summer leads to surface ice melting and water pooling, causing fractures to form in the ice. However, the action of the meltwater alone is insufficient to produce fractures deep enough to cause calving. When the air tem- perature lowers at the beginning of winter, falling snow accumulates in the fractures, increasing the pressure on the ice, eventually causing calving. After a large snowfall, calving can occur within a few days. Student 3 Antarctic ice shelves melt only from below. During the summer, ocean currents circulate water that is just above freezing into and out of the basal cavity (the area underneath an ice shelf), causing the ice within the cavity to melt. For every 0.1°C that the ocean water is above freezing, the water melts a thickness of 10 m of ice from the bottom per year. When the ice shelf thickness has been reduced by at least 50 m, calving occurs. Student 4 The warmer water circulated by ocean currents melts the ice shelf as described by Student 3. However, calving cannot occur from this process alone. Snow accumulates on the surface of the ice each winter, but each following summer, warm air leads to the melting and compaction of the snow. The compaction lowers the surface of the ice shelf, pushing the ice down into the basal cavity, where it is melted by the ocean water. After several winter-summer cycles, the ice shelf becomes top-heavy due to the snow and the melting from below, and calving occurs. 6. Which of the following diagrams best shows the loca- tion of the basal cavity as described by Student 3? F.

They conducted 2 experiments to test their hypothesis. Experiment 1 Two kilograms of a particular variety of raw tomatoes were sliced and then blended in a food processor until a homogeneous (uniform) tomato mixture was produced. The mixture was divided into 4 equal samples (Samples 1 − 4). Each sample was placed in a separate plastic bag, and the bags were sealed. The bag containing Sample 1 was imme- diately frozen at − 40°C. The bags containing Samples 2 − 4 were each incubated in a water bath at 88°C for a different period of time (see Table 1) and then frozen at − 40°C.

Crystals form inside the ingot as it cools. The average crystal length, L , in micrometers ( μ m), deter- mines how brittle the ingot will be. A method for reducing L using rotating magnetic fields was applied to Alloy Q as it cooled in the molds. Table 1 shows the elemental compo- sition of Alloy Q. Figure 1 shows the effect of the relative magnetic stirring force, F , on L for ingots formed from molten Alloy Q that had an initial temperature of either 280°C or 550°C.

DOC is subsequently removed from the water if it is adsorbed by (becomes adhered to the sur- face of) clay mineral particles that are suspended in the water. Three studies done at a lake examined DOC adsorp- tion by 3 clay minerals—CM1, CM2, and CM3—found in the lake’s sediment. Green leaves were collected from 5 types of trees around the lake (maple, oak, pine, magnolia, and rhodo- dendron). A 5 L volume of lake water was filtered to remove all solid particles. The following procedures were performed for each type of leaf: A 100 g sample of the leaves was mixed with a 1 L volume of the filtered lake water. The mixture was then placed in the dark for 10 weeks at 4°C while leaching occurred. At 10 weeks, the mixture was filtered to remove all solid particles. The resulting liquid (the leachate) was analyzed for DOC. Study 1 The following procedures were performed for each leachate: A 100 mL volume of the leachate was mixed with 10 g of CM1. The mixture was stirred continuously for 2 hr, then filtered to remove all solid particles. The result- ing liquid (the filtrate) was analyzed for DOC. The percent of the leachate DOC that had been adsorbed by CM1 was calculated (see Figure 1).

An electron will be ejected if the energy, E , of a photon (particle of light) striking the plate is greater than the minimum energy, M , required for the electron to be removed from the plate. The maximum kinetic energy of the ejected electron, K , is the difference between E and M as shown in the equation: K = E − M Students conducted 2 experiments to examine how differences in the light striking a metal plate affect K . The setup included a light source, a removable filter, a circuit with an ammeter to measure current, a power supply that could be adjusted to measure K , and a vacuum tube con- taining a metal plate and an electrode (see Figure 1). Figure 1 power supply electrons vacuum tube ammeter metal plate light filter electrode 19.8 mA Experiment 1 A filter was placed between the metal plate and the light source, and the K of the ejected electrons was mea- sured. This procedure was repeated with each of 4 addi- tional filters. Each filter transmitted light of only one frequency. Table 1 lists the following: • color of light transmitted by the filter • frequency of light in hertz, Hz • E in electron volts, eV • K in electron volts Table 1 Color Frequency ( × 10 14 Hz) E (eV) K (eV) Red 4.4 1.81 N.A.* Yellow 5.2 2.14 N.A.* Green 5.6 2.31 0.11 Blue 6.3 2.60 0.40 Violet 7.5 3.10 0.90 *N.A.—Not available; no electrons were ejected. Experiment 2 With the same setup as in Experiment 1 except with- out a filter, the current, in milliamperes (mA), and K were measured as the intensity of the light was varied. Table 2 shows the current and K for 4 different relative light inten- sities, each given as a percent of maximum intensity.

Page 61 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 Outer Space The United States and other nations have been exploring outer space for more than 50 years. Orbiting Earth, visiting the Moon, and maintaining an international space station have been landmarks of technological and scientific achievement. But major problems persist on the home planet, including hunger, disease, and pollution. Plans for further space exploration—sending people to Mars, for example—compete for financial and intellectual resources that could be used to help address these problems. To what extent, then, should we continue to explore outer space? Read and carefully consider these perspectives. Each suggests a particular way of thinking about the question above. Perspective One Perspective Two Perspective Three The pursuit of greater knowledge is worth any expense. Even if exploring space does not solve problems at home, it increases our understanding of the universe and our place within it. Life on Earth must always be our first priority. Exploring outer space is not more important than feeding people on Earth and ensuring the health of the planet. Scientific and technological achievements are the key to progress for humankind. By exploring outer space, we may discover new solutions to old problems. Essay Task Write a unified, coherent essay in which you address the question of whether we should continue to explore outer space. In your essay, be sure to: • clearly state your own perspective and analyze the relationship between your perspective and at least one other perspective • develop and support your ideas with reasoning and examples • organize your ideas clearly and logically • communicate your ideas effectively in standard written English Your perspective may be in full agreement with any of those given, in partial agreement, or completely different. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp.

Page 72 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 How to Score the Practice Multiple-Choice Tests Follow the instructions below and on the following pages to score your practice multiple- choice tests and review your performance. To calculate your writing score, use Scoring the Practice Writing Test, page 78 . Raw Scores The number of questions you answered correctly on each test section is a raw score. Because there are many forms of the ACT, each with different questions, the difficulty level varies between the forms. A raw score of 35 on one form of the mathematics test section, for example, may be about as difficult to earn as a raw score of 37 on another form of that test section. Computing raw scores: To compute your raw scores, check your answers with the scoring information in the scoring keys and conversion table, then do the following: 1. Mark a one (1) in the blank for each question answered correctly. 2. Count the number of correct answers for each of the multiple-choice test sections. 3. Add up the total number correct for each category and test section and capture it as directed beneath its scoring key. Use the scoring key for each test to score your answer document for the sections in the practice test. Mark a “1” in the blank for each question you answered correctly and add up the total number correct for each test. Do not count correct answers for gray cells, as those are for field test items not included in converting raw scores to scale scores. Please note, the placement of these field test questions varies across different test forms, and will NOT remain in the same test item slots each test administration. These numbers are your raw scores on the individual multiple-choice test sections. The highest raw score for a given test section is the number of questions included on that test section: • English: 40 • Mathematics: 41 • Reading: 27 • Science: 34 Note: Raw scores are also provided as part of the Summary Report for each test section taken online in TestNav. Scale Scores To adjust for the small differences among different forms of the ACT test, raw scores are converted into scale scores. Scale scores appear on reports sent to your school. When your raw scores are converted into scale scores, it becomes possible to compare your scores with those of examinees who took different test forms. For example, a scale score of 26 on the mathematics test section has the same meaning for any form of the ACT. Converting Raw Scores to Scale Scores: Each ACT test section generates a single scale score between 1 and 36. Use the scale score conversion table to convert your raw scores to scale scores for each test section. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved.

If you are taking the test on paper prior to September 2025, please refer to the version of the Preparing for the ACT guide labeled 2024|2025. If you are preparing for State and District prior to spring of 2026, you should refer to the Fall 2025 Preparing for the ACT provided by your school. An ACT test generates a single Composite score of 1–36. Compute the Composite score by averaging the three scale scores: 1. Add your English, Mathematics, and Reading scale scores. Enter this sum in the blanks below. 2. Divide the sum by 3. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less than one-half, except for averages lower than one; round up any fraction that is one- half or more. Also round up averages that are less than one.) 3. Enter this number in the blank below. This is your Composite score. Composite of scale scores: English Scale Score = Mathematics Scale Score = Reading Scale Score = Sum of Scale Scores = Composite score (sum ÷ 3) = Note: If you left a test section completely blank and marked no items, do not list a scale score for that section and do not calculate a Composite score. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 78 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 Scoring the Practice Writing Test It’s difficult to be objective about your own work. However, it’s to your advantage to read your own writing critically, as doing so can help you grow as a writer and as a reader. It may also be helpful for you to give your practice essay to another reader, such as a classmate, parent, or teacher. To rate your essay, you and your reader(s) should review the guidelines and sample essays at http://www.actstudent.org and then use The ACT Writing Test Scoring Rubric, starting on the next page to assign your practice essay a score of 1 (low) through 6 (high) in each of the four writing domains (Ideas & Analysis, Development & Support, Organization, and Language Use). Scoring Rubric The rubric presents the standards by which your essay will be evaluated. Readers will use this rubric to assign your essay four unique scores, one per writing domain. These are the six possible rubric scores: Score 6: Responses demonstrate effective skill in writing an argumentative essay. Score 5: Responses demonstrate well-developed skill in writing an argumentative essay. Score 4: Responses demonstrate adequate skill in writing an argumentative essay. Score 3: Responses demonstrate some developing skill in writing an argumentative essay. Score 2: Responses demonstrate weak or inconsistent skill in writing an argumentative essay. Score 1: Responses demonstrate little or no skill in writing an argumentative essay. Because each domain receives its own score, the four scores you assign need not be identical. For example, you may find that your essay exhibits stronger skill in organization than in the development of ideas. In this case, you may determine that your essay should receive a higher score in Organization than in Development & Support. Calculating Your Writing Score The writing test section generates a single score of 2–12. Complete these steps to calculate your writing score: 1. Determine which score (range 1–6) in each of the four domains best describes the features of your writing. 2. Multiply each rubric score by 2 to get a score for each domain (range 2–12). 3. Add your four domain scores. Enter this sum of domain scores in the blank below (range 8–48). 4. Divide the sum by 4. If the resulting number ends in a fraction, round it to the nearest whole number. (Round down any fraction less than one-half; round up any fraction that is one-half or more.)

Page 79 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 The ACT Writing Test Scoring Rubric Ideas & Analysis Domain Rubric Score Ideas & Analysis Scoring Standards 6 The writer generates an argument that critically engages with multiple perspectives on the given issue. The argument’s thesis reflects nuance and precision in thought and purpose. The argument establishes and employs an insightful context for analysis of the issue and its perspectives. The analysis examines implications, complexities, tensions, and/or underlying values and assumptions. 5 The writer generates an argument that productively engages with multiple perspectives on the given issue. The argument’s thesis reflects precision in thought and purpose. The argument establishes and employs a thoughtful context for analysis of the issue and its perspectives. The analysis addresses implications, complexities, tensions and/or underlying values and assumptions. 4 The writer generates an argument that engages with multiple perspectives on the given issue. The argument’s thesis reflects clarity in thought and purpose. The argument establishes and employs a relevant context for analysis of the issue and its perspectives. The analysis recognizes implications, complexities, tensions, and/or underlying values and assumptions. 3 The writer generates an argument that responds to multiple perspectives on the given issue. The argument’s thesis reflects some clarity in thought and purpose. The argument establishes a limited or tangential context for analysis of the issue and its perspectives. Analysis is simplistic or somewhat unclear. 2 The writer generates an argument that weakly responds to multiple perspectives on the given issue. The argument’s thesis, if evident, reflects little clarity in thought and purpose. Attempts at analysis are incomplete, largely irrelevant, or consist primarily of restatement of the issue and its perspectives. 1 The writer fails to generate an argument that responds intelligibly to the task. The writer’s intentions are difficult to discern. Attempts at analysis are unclear or irrelevant Development & Support Domain Rubric Score Development & Support Scoring Standards 6 Development of ideas and support for claims deepen insight and broaden context. An integrated line of skillful reasoning and illustration effectively conveys the significance of the argument. Qualifications and complications enrich and bolster ideas and analysis. 5 Development of ideas and support for claims deepen understanding. A mostly integrated line of purposeful reasoning and illustration capably conveys the significance of the argument. Qualifications and complications enrich ideas and analysis. 4 Development of ideas and support for claims clarify meaning and purpose. Lines of clear reasoning and illustration adequately convey the significance of the argument. Qualifications and complications extend ideas and analysis. 3 Development of ideas and support for claims are mostly relevant but are overly general or simplistic. Reasoning and illustration largely clarify the argument but may be somewhat repetitious or imprecise. 2 Development of ideas and support for claims are weak, confused, or disjointed. Reasoning and illustration are inadequate, illogical, or circular, and fail to fully clarify the argument. 1 Ideas lack development and claims lack support. Reasoning and illustration are unclear, incoherent, or largely absent. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 80 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 Organization Domain Rubric Score Organization Scoring Standards 6 The response exhibits a skillful organizational strategy. The response is unified by a controlling idea or purpose, and a logical progression of ideas increases the effectiveness of the writer’s argument. Transitions between and within paragraphs strengthen the relationships among ideas. 5 The response exhibits a productive organizational strategy. The response is mostly unified by a controlling idea or purpose, and a logical sequencing of ideas contributes to the effectiveness of the argument. Transitions between and within paragraphs consistently clarify the relationships among ideas. 4 The response exhibits a clear organizational strategy. The overall shape of the response reflects an emergent controlling idea or purpose. Ideas are logically grouped and sequenced. Transitions between and within paragraphs clarify the relationships among ideas. 3 The response exhibits a basic organizational structure. The response largely coheres, with most ideas logically grouped. Transitions between and within paragraphs sometimes clarify the relationships among ideas. 2 The response exhibits a rudimentary organizational structure. Grouping of ideas is inconsistent and often unclear. Transitions between and within paragraphs are misleading or poorly formed. 1 The response does not exhibit an organizational structure. There is little grouping of ideas. When present, transitional devices fail to connect ideas. Language Use Domain Rubric Score Language Use Scoring Standards 6 The use of language enhances the argument. Word choice is skillful and precise. Sentence structures are consistently varied and clear. Stylistic and register choices, including voice and tone, are strategic and effective. While a few minor errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics may be present, they do not impede understanding. 5 The use of language works in service of the argument. Word choice is precise. Sentence structures are clear and varied often. Stylistic and register choices, including voice and tone, are purposeful and productive. While minor errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics may be present, they do not impede understanding. 4 The use of language conveys the argument with clarity. Word choice is adequate and sometimes precise. Sentence structures are clear and demonstrate some variety. Stylistic and register choices, including voice and tone, are appropriate for the rhetorical purpose. While errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics are present, they rarely impede understanding. 3 The use of language is basic and only somewhat clear. Word choice is general and occasionally imprecise. Sentence structures are usually clear but show little variety. Stylistic and register choices, including voice and tone, are not always appropriate for the rhetorical purpose. Distracting errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics may be present, but they generally do not impede understanding. 2 The use of language is inconsistent and often unclear. Word choice is rudimentary and frequently imprecise. Sentence structures are sometimes unclear. Stylistic and register choices, including voice and tone, are inconsistent and are not always appropriate for the rhetorical purpose. Distracting errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics are present, and they sometimes impede understanding. 1 The use of language fails to demonstrate skill in responding to the task. Word choice is imprecise and often difficult to comprehend. Sentence structures are often unclear. Stylistic and register choices are difficult to identify. Errors in grammar, usage, and mechanics are pervasive and often impede understanding. ©2025 by ACT Education Corp. All rights reserved. Page 81 of 82 QU00002.CJ19373 Next Steps Your practice test score is an estimate of the score that you would receive during an actual administration of the ACT test. Reflecting on your practice experience can be useful as you continue to prepare for test day. Consider the following as you review your scores as part of your general test performance: l Pacing: Did you run out of time? Reread the information in this booklet on pacing yourself. You may need to adjust the way you use your time in responding to the questions. l Directions: Did you spend too much time trying to understand the directions for the test sections? Make sure you understand them before test day. l Misses: Review the questions that you missed. Did you select a response that was an incomplete answer or that did not directly respond to the question being asked? Try to figure out what you overlooked in answering the questions. l Types: Did a particular type of question confuse you? In reviewing your responses, check to see whether a particular type of question was more difficult for you.
